What is an Algorithoms?

=>An Algorithoms is a set of well defigned insturctions to solve a Particular Problem.

What is time complexity?

=>Amount of time taken by an algorithom to run ,as a function of input size.

What is space complexity?

=>Amount of space taken by an algorithom to run ,as a funtion of input size.


How to represent complexity?

=>To represent Complexity we use 

#Big-O Notation (o-notation) -Worst Case complexity,
#Omega notation -Best Case Complexity,
#Theta Notation -Average Case Complexity


What is Big-O Notiation?
=>Big-O Notation describe the complexity of an algorithoms using algebraic terms.

It has two important characteristics,
*It is expressed in terms of the input
*It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details.



Time Complexity

*Big-O(n)=Linear
*Big-O(1)=Constant
*Big-O(n^2)=Quadratic
*Big-O(n^3)=Cubic
*Big-O(logn)=Logarithmic

Space Complexity

*Big-O(n)=Linear
*Big-O(1)=Constant
*Big-O(logn)=Logarithmic
